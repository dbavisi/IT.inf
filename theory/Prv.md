# Prv.0/1
`Prv.0/1` is the collection of principles, and assumptions upon which
the `IT.inf`, its clauses and the Inference Engines are built.

---
In accordance with `IT.0/1`, each section title within this document is
inherently treated as a tag.

Prv.1/1
-------
Information Tagging is a core component for the functioning of `IT.inf`.
This section illustrates the syntax of the IT tags, and the stages of
completeness crucial for distinguishing the level of specification
of the tags within `IT.inf`.

- `IT.inf` is a unique tag that references the project itself.
- `IT.0/1` is a unique tag that refers to the concept of
  Information Tagging itself.
- `IT.1/1` or fully-defined tags, represents a concept that is closed
  in terms of its definition and has all necessary attributes, and
  relationships explicitly defined.
- `IT.2/1` or eventually-defined tags, represents a concept that is
  expected to be fully-defined when the underlying principles are
  expected to be fully-defined but lacks clarity in the absence of
  appropriate context.
- `IT.3/1` or undefined-tags, represents a concept that completely
  lacks clarity unless explicitly modified.

> `IT.0/1` is not about naming what you see;
> Its about marking what you notice.

Prv.2/1
-------
This section lists the fundamental concepts and relations.

- `IT.4/1` or Data, is inherently useless in its raw form;
- `IT.5/1` or Information, is the same `IT.4/1`, however, is useful;
- `IT.6/1` or Knowledge, is an ability to transform the `IT.4/1`
  into `IT.5/1`.
- `IT.7/1` or Inference, is the process of transformation which is
  described by `IT.6/1`.
- `IT.8/1` or Inference Engine, is the facilitator of `IT.7/1`.
- `IT.9/1` or Spirit, is the facilitator of `IT.6/1`.

`IT.10/1` or Attributes, are the defining qualities or properties that
specify, differentiate, and enhance context and detailed specifications,
allowing for the refinement, and comprehension of the associated concept.

---
The set of tags provided thus far is integral and will be extensively
utilized and employed autonomously within the `IT.inf` system for any
relevant operations.
